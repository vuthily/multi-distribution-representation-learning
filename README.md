# multi-distribution-representation-learning
- This is a part of implementation code for multi-distribution representation learning.
- For model comparision, we used the Deep Belief Network code from https://github.com/JosephGatto/Deep-Belief-Networks-Tensorflow
- We are re-organizing the main code. We will update fully soon.
